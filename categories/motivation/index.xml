      <description>What is startup? Before i explain my opinion about definition of startup. I want to share my first story when build my first startup OnanOnan.com. My future goal is become a success enterpreneur and build social company.
In my mind the first opinion about startup is start a new small company, get a revenue, there is a CEO, CTO etc. That&amp;rsquo;s my first opinion about startup . So, the next question when your company is not called startup anymore?</description>
