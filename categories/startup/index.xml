      <description>Startups looking for angel investors or venture capital (VC) absolutely need an exit strategy because investors require it. The exit is what gives them a return. Exit strategies related to startup funding are quite often misunderstood: The “exit” in exit strategy is for the money, not the startup founders or small business owners. The company brings in money and the investors get money out. So startups looking for angel investors or venture capital (VC) absolutely need an exit strategy because investors require it.</description>

      <description>What is startup? Before i explain my opinion about definition of startup. I want to share my first story when build my first startup OnanOnan.com. My future goal is become a success enterpreneur and build social company.
In my mind the first opinion about startup is start a new small company, get a revenue, there is a CEO, CTO etc. That&amp;rsquo;s my first opinion about startup . So, the next question when your company is not called startup anymore?</description>
