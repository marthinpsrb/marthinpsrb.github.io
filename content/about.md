Hello there,

My name is Marthin

I was born in Sibolga, Indonesia, a very small town in North Sumatera Province, Indonesia. I have informatics engineering background from IT Del in Sitoluama, Laguboti.

When I graduated from high school, I had absolutely no interest in computer science and have plan to take mechanical engineering to continue my studies. But one of my family member, share a bit about mobile apps and how we got money from these applications. And yaa, finally I decided to take informatics engineering.

In the first year as a college student, it was very difficult for me. Imagine, how you try to love something which you don't love it before. Yes, but I did it. How? 
I started looking for what I love from the computer science, and you know **HTML** changes my life (for the first year we still learn basic thing about software engineering) ðŸ˜„. And once you start to like it then what's next? Don't worry suffering is not over. 
After the class over, I repeatedly write the code but in different cases. For example in the classroom, we learn about create a website for private blog, and I repeatedly write the same code and try with another use case e.g restaurant menu. Yes, i did it mostly every day after the class over in 2 years

After I finished with coding problems, I was getting bored and wanted to find other activities. I started to join organization in campus and got chance as chairman of the student executive board(BEM) for a year.

Then, after my term as chairman of the student executive board ended, I started thinking about starting a startup. In 2016, I started my own startup with my friends. We build market place called **OnanOnan**. We provide online store to help local people to sell their local product. We're focusing to sell local product Batak Ethnic. At the end of 2016 again i create another startup which called **Medan Digital Center(MDC)**, it was software house. We're creating application for our client, like website, mobile apps (iOS, Android, Windows Phone), games, etc.

In the final year of college, I had the opportunity to do an internship in South Korea for 4 months in 2017. The program held by Gyeonggi province, South Korea and Ministry of Research and Technology Indonesia. After that, one of my mentor in South Korea invite me to join his startup in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia as Fullstack engineer. I moved to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia in 2018. After spend 8 months there, i decided to build my own startup called **Onan**. Onan is mobile app provide some service like Printing, Pulsa, and Food Delivery service.

In 2019, I started work for an Indonesian company called Gojek specificly in GoPay team as iOS Engineer, got chance to stay with my team in **Bangalore, India** for 6 months, and currently work in Gojek Office Jakarta.
