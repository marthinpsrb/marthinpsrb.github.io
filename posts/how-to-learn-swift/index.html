<p><a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a> was released in 2014 as open-source language. I started learning Swift around 2 weeks ago. There are a lot of ways to go about learning Swift, and the lesson can be done on your own time.</p>
<p>New Programming language, it means a new experience. For me, most of them have the same concept but have a different approach. Like in Java for collection type they have Array, HashMap, LinkedList, ArrayList, etc. But in Swift for Collection Type, they just have Array, Set, and Dictionary. If I can compare, HashMap and Dictionary look similar.</p>
<p>Basically, what Iâ€™m doing when I learn is basically read the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html">documentation</a>, and also open the XCode and try the concept directly using the playground in XCode. When I missing something, I will be coming back to the documentation or look for another source on someoneâ€™s blog.</p>
<p>This blog is only to give you direction on how to learn swift, but itâ€™s not fully true, you can find your own way to learn.</p>
<h4 id="learn-basics-from-the-apple-documentation">Learn basics from the Apple documentation</h4>
<p>You can go fast if you directly jump into building an iOS app, but you will never go far if you donâ€™t know what is the basic swift. Spend a lot of time learning basic things is good for your future. Also, you can find the best practice, which is a good or bad way when you know the basic part. So, itâ€™s better to first know about the basic things.</p>

<h4 id="learn-from-original-reference-but-">Learn from original reference, but â€¦.</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you searching to learn about swift to get the source to learning, you will get so many results for that. But the question is, is it a good source?</li>
<li>Itâ€™s better to read from the apple documentation first</li>
<li>If you think you still not get the message you can find from other sources may be a blog from someone so It will be helpful for you in understanding easily</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="learning-and-practice">Learning and Practice</h4>
<ul>
<li>Outside from learning the documentation, you need to practice with what you learn.</li>
<li>You should use XCode Playground beside learning about swift with theoretically. It helps you to understand the concept by context.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="document-it">Document It</h4>
<p>Nobodyâ€™s perfect since we are human ðŸ˜„. We have limitations to remember something, so itâ€™s better to put some notes on the important part. My mentor said, forgetting 20 percent is acceptable, but not more than that. It means you should understand not memorize.</p>
<h4 id="ask-questions">Ask Questions</h4>
<p>When we learn something new, itâ€™s better to not make an assumption of that. I mean when you learn something and you feel doubt about what you get. Ask your mentor, ask your friends who have experience in it. Donâ€™t be shy, itâ€™s better you know youâ€™re wrong at the beginning.</p>
<h4 id="find-your-mentor">Find your mentor</h4>
<p>You donâ€™t want to go far but can have the wrong direction, right? So, first, find your mentor to help and give direction for you how to learn. Itâ€™s not mandatory, but it can help you to learn fast. You can make targets with your mentor, and also get feedback from them.</p>
<p>To make you conform with Swift, I suggest you do more exercise solving a problem with Swift. You can go to <a href="https://cyber-dojo.org/">Cyber Dojo</a> for more practice about Swift</p>
