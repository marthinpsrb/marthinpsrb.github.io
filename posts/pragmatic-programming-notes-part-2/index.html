<p><strong>To be successful in your career, you must manage your knowledge portfolio using these same guidelines:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Invest Regularly
Just as in financial investing, you must invest in your knowledge portfolio regularly. Even if it&rsquo;s just a small amount, the habit itself is as important as the sums
Diversify</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversify
The more different things you know, the more valuable you. The more technologies you are comfortable with, the better you will be able to adjust to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage Risk
It&rsquo;s not a good idea to invest all of your money in high-risk stocks that might collapse suddenly, nor should you invest all of it conservatively and miss out on possible opportunity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy Low, Sell High
Learning Java when it first came out may have been risky, but it paid off handsomely for the early adopters who are now at the top of that field</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review and Balance
This is a very dynamic industry. That hot technology you started investigating last month might be stone cold by now. Maybe you need to brush up on that database technology that you haven&rsquo;t used in a while</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Learn at least one new language every year</strong></p>
<p>By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read a technical book each quarter</strong></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re in the habit, read a book a month. After you&rsquo;ve mastered the technologies you&rsquo;re currently using, branch out and study some that don&rsquo;t relate to your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read nontechnical books, too</strong></p>
<p>It is important to remember that computers are used by people—people whose needs you are trying to satisfy. Don&rsquo;t forget the human side of the equation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take classes</strong></p>
<p>Look for interesting courses at your local community college or university, or perhaps at the next trade show that comes to town</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Participate in local user groups</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just go and listen, but actively participate. Isolation can be deadly to your career; find out what people are working on outside of your company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experiment with different environments.</strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve worked only in Windows, play with Unix at home (the freely available Linux is perfect for this). If you&rsquo;ve used only makefiles and an editor, try an IDE, and vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay current</strong></p>
<p>Subscribe to trade magazines and other journals. Choose some that cover technology different from that of your current project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get wired</strong>
Want to know the ins and outs of a new language or other technology? Newsgroups are a great way to find out what experiences other people are having with it, the particular jargon they use, and so on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>With the global adoption of the Internet, gurus suddenly are as close as your Enter key. So, how do you find one, and how do you get one to talk with you?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Know exactly what you want to ask, and be as specific as you can be.</li>
<li>Frame your question carefully and politely. Remember that you&rsquo;re asking a favor; don&rsquo;t seem to be demanding an answer.</li>
<li>Once you&rsquo;ve framed your questioned, stop and look again for the answer. Pick out some keywords and search the web. Look for appropriate FAQs (lists of frequently asked questions with answers).</li>
<li>Decide if you want to ask publicly or privately. Usenet news-groups are wonderful meeting places for experts on just about any topic, but some people are wary of these groups' public nature. Alternatively, you can always e-mail your guru directly. Either way, use a meaningful subject line.</li>
<li>Sit back and be patient. People are busy, and it may take days to get a specific answer.
Finally, please be sure to thank anyone who responds you. And if you see people asking questions you can answer, play your part and participate.</li>
</ol>
