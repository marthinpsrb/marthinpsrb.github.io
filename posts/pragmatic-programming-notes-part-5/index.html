<h4 id="you-cant-write-perfect-software">You Can’t Write Perfect Software</h4>
<p>Did that hurt? It shouldn’t. Accept it as an axiom of life. Embrace it. Celebrate it. Because perfect software doesn’t exist. We are constantly interfacing with other people’s code—code that might not live up to our high standards—and dealing with inputs that may or may not be valid.</p>
<p>So we are taught to code defensively. If there’s any doubt, we validate all information we’re given. We use assertions to detect bad data. We check for consistency, put constraints on database columns, and generally feel pretty good about ourselves.</p>
<p>But Pragmatic Programmers take this a step further. They don’t trust themselves, either. Knowing that no one writes perfect code, including themselves, Pragmatic Programmers code in defenses against their own mistakes.</p>
<h4 id="design-by-contractdbc">Design By Contract(DBC)</h4>
<p>One of the best solutions for ensuring plain dealing is the contract. A contract defines your rights and responsibilities, as well as those of the other party.</p>
<p>Every function and method in a software system does something. Before it starts that something, the routine may have some expectation of the state of the world, and it may be able to make a statement about the state of the world when it concludes. Meyer describes these expectations and claims as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>What must be true in order for the routine to be called; the routine’s requirements. A routine should never get called when its preconditions would be violated. It is the caller’s responsibility to pass good data (see the box on page 115)</li>
<li>What the routine is guaranteed to do; the state of the world when the routine is done. The fact that the routine has a postcondition implies that it will conclude: infinite loops aren’t allowed.</li>
<li>Class invariants. A class ensures that this condition is always true from the perspective of a caller. During internal processing of a routine, the invariant may not hold, but by the time the routine exits and control returns to the caller, the invariant must be true. (Note that a class cannot give unrestricted write-access to any data member that participates in the invariant.)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="design-with-contracts">Design with Contracts</h4>
<p>In Orthogonality, we recommended writing “shy” code. Here, the emphasis is on “lazy” code: be strict in what you will accept before you begin, and promise as little as possible in return.</p>
<p>Remember, if your contract indicates that you’ll accept anything and promise the world in return, then you’ve got a lot of code to write!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-tex" data-lang="tex">Subclasses must be usable through the base class interface without the need for the user to know the difference.
</code></pre></div><p>For example, consider the Java base class java.awt.Component. You can treat any visual component in AWT or Swing as a Component, without knowing that the actual subclass is a button, a canvas, a menu, or whatever. Each individual component can provide additional, specific functionality, but it has to provide at least the basic capabilities defined by Component</p>
<p>In languages that do not support DBC in the code, this might be as far as you can go—and that’s not too bad. DBC is, after all, a design technique. Even without automatic checking, you can put the contract in the code as comments and still get a very real benefit</p>
<p>While documenting these assumptions is a great start, you can get much greater benefit by having the compiler check your contract for you. You can partially emulate this in some languages by using assertions (see Assertive Programming). Why only partially? Can’t you use assertions to do everything DBC can do?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the answer is no. To begin with, there is no support for propagating assertions down an inheritance hierarchy. This means that if you override a base class method that has a contract, the assertions that implement that contract will not be called correctly (unless you duplicate them manually in the new code). You must remember to call the class invariant (and all base class invariants) manually before you exit every method. The basic problem is that the contract is not automatically enforced.</p>
<p><strong>Who is reponsible for checking the precondition</strong></p>
<p>Crash Early</p>
<p><strong>Crash, Don’t Trash</strong></p>
<p>One of the benefits of detecting problems as soon as you can is that you can crash earlier. And many times, crashing your program is the best thing you can do. The alternative may be to continue, writing corrupted data to some vital database or commanding the washing machine into its twentieth consecutive spin cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Assertive Programming</strong></p>
<p>There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel no one else has a right to blame us.</p>
<p><code>This code won’t be used 30 years from now, so two-digit dates are fine.</code> , <code>This application will never be used abroad, so why internationalize it?</code> <code>count can’t be negative.</code> <code>This printf can’t fail.</code></p>
<p>Let’s not practice this kind of self-deception, particularly when coding.</p>
<p>If It Can’t Happen, Use Assertions to Ensure That It Won’t</p>
<p>If you need to free resources, have an assertion failure generate an exception, longjmp to an exit point, or call an error handler</p>
<p>First, they assume that testing finds all the bugs. In reality, for any complex program you are unlikely to test even a miniscule percentage of the permutations your code will be put through</p>
<p>Second, the optimists are forgetting that your program runs in a dangerous world. During testing, rats probably won’t gnaw through a communications cable, someone playing a game won’t exhaust memory, and log files won’t fill the hard drive.</p>
